I just released an overhauled version of `oset`, namely [`oset-0.4.0.1`][oset-0.4.0.1]. Here are the highlights:

* Covers entire `OSet` API from [ordered-containers][ordered-containers]
* Introduces left- and right-biased ordered sets `OSetL` and `OSetR`
* One breaking change: `fromList` has been renamed `fromListL`

[ordered-containers]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ordered-containers
[oset-0.4.0.1]: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/oset-0.4.0.1
