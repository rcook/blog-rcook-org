I have decided to open-source my [Lanscan](http://lanscan.rcook.org/) network
scanning Windows Store app. The source code is now available at
[GitHub](https://github.com/rcook/lanscan). I no longer have time to maintain
this project (and, in fact, the most recent release was almost a year ago) and
so I'm opening it up to the community in the hopes that it might be of use to
someone. If I or anybody else has time to contribute fixes or features, I will
continue to publish new updated versions of the app to the Windows Store.
