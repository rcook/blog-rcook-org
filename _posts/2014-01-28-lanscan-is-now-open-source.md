I have decided to open-source my [Lanscan](http://lanscan.rcook.org/) network scanning Windows Store app. The source code is now available at [GitHub](https://github.com/rcook/lanscan). I no longer have time to maintain this project (and, in fact, the most recent release was almost a year ago) and so I'm opening it up to the community in the hopes that it might be of use to someone. If I or anybody else has time to contribute fixes or features, I will continue to publish new updated versions of the app to the Windows Store.
