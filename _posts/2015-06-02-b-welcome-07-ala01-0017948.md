Now the family's complete!

On the downside, I don't think the composite video to VGA converter is going to
cut it. The vertical scaling is off and is going to be difficult to use. I think
I'm going to look into how to connect the RGB output to a modern monitor. That
is supposed to be the best-quality output anyway.
