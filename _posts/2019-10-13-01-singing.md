I finished and released my little solo album, [Psychosomatic][psychosomatic],
to little or no fanfare. I'm proud of it, though I am very self-conscious about
my singing. True to my word, I have started to do something about it: I had my
first singing lession yesterday at [Will's Vocal Studio][will].
