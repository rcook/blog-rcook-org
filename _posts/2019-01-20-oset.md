I just published a partial implementation of what I will refer to as an "insertion-order-preserving set". The API (as well as the module, type and function names) is derived from that of [`Data.Set.Ordered`][data-set-ordered] from the [`ordered-containers`][ordered-containers] package.

I found this implementation's lack of [`Foldable`][foldable], [`Semigroup`][semigroup], [`Monoid`][monoid] and [`Data`][data] instances annoying. I've filed some [bugs][ordered-containers-issues] and submitted some pull requests so we'll see if I can get this original package updated. In the meantime, I need to have something working right now, so I've created [`oset`][oset] ([GitHub][github]) with a type of the exact same name, [`Data.Set.Ordered`][oset-data-set-ordered].

Note that this package does not implement the full `ordered-containers` API: it only implements the bits that I currently need. I've been adding new bits as I need them. I also spent some time analysing the complexity bounds of the various functions and documenting these systematically in the package.

I'm going to hold off publishing this to [Hackage][hackage] in the hope that this project can be mothballed in the long term.
