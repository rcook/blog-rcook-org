I just published a partial implementation of what I will refer to as an insertion-order-preserving set. The API (as well as the module, type and function names) is derived from that of [`Data.Set.Ordered`][data-set-ordered] from the [ordered-containers][ordered-containers] package.

I found this implementation's lack of `Foldable`, `Semigroup`, `Monoid` and `Data` instances annoying. I've filed some [bugs][ordered-containers-issues] and submitted some pull requests so we'll see if I can get this original package updated. In the meantime, I need to have something working right now, so I've created [oset][oset] ([GitHub][github]) with a type of the exact same name, [`Data.Set.Ordered`][oset-data-set-ordered]. Note that this package does not implement the full ordered-containers API: it only implements the bits that I currently need. I've been adding new bits as I need them.

I'm going to hold off publishing this to [Hackage][hackage] in the hope that this project can be mothballed in the long term.
