I'm currently working through [Machine Learning in Action][mlinaction] with the
goal of learning some machine learning and translating the code into Haskell.

Here's my translation of the _k_-nearest-neighbour implementation from chapter
2:

{% gist eca401a3f5796c01b4e8493d99637d0d Classify0.hs %}

Note that this depends on some of the helper functions in my
[`LAUtil` modules][lautil].
