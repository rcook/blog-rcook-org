As part of my Acorn Electron-related nostalgia trip, I've forked a couple of
open-source projects:

* [Elkulator][1]: The venerable Electron emulator: I've hacked around with the
way it loads sideways RAM and ROM just to fit my workflow
* [Bascat][2]: Detokenizer for BBC Basic programs: in fact this is how I created
[this][3] blog post
