Just a quickie today! I've started using [Req][req] for HTTP APIs in Haskell. I just published a new package of my own by the name of [req-url-extra][req-url-extra] which adds a couple of simple helper functions for manipulating URLs.

Done.

[req]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/req
[req-url-extra]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/req-url-extra
