Today I bring you more guitar stuff! I'm learning how to set up guitars properly by making my [Squier Silver Series][silver-series] [play great][dan-erlewine-book]. When I used to do this kind of stuff ten or fifteen years ago, pickings were slim. Now there are so many good-quality free resources on YouTube and elsewhere providing all the information you might need to fix up your guitar. Here are some of my favourites:

* [FruduaTV][frudua-tv]
* [Darrell Braun Guitar][darrell-braun]
* [Your Guitar Academy][your-guitar-academy]

This is what I've done so far:

* Refloated the bridge: I blocked off the tremolo years as I always had difficulty keeping this guitar in tune: after following the advice given in video linked from my [previous post]({% post_url 2019-03-16-the-frudua-way %}), things are much better
* Polished the frets
* Set the action via the truss rod and saddle height adjustments
* Set the saddle heights for proper curvature using my new radius gauges
* Replaced the original strap buttons with Schaller-compatible strap buttons

Things I'm hoping to do over the next few weeks:

* Replace the tuners with locking tuners
* Replace the nut with a graphite unit or file and lube the existing nut properly
* Tweak or remove one or more string trees
* Clean up the electrics with some contact cleaner

This guitar is by far the most customized guitar I own. If you're observant, you'll notice that the pickguard, pickups and string trees at the very least are not original. The guitar was originally equipped with single-coil pickups in the standard Strat configuration. I replaced all the pickups years ago with custom units. I don't remember what the single coils are, but I do know that the humbucker I installed in the bridge position is some kind of [Kent Armstrong][kent-armstrong] Motherbucker. Due to the HSS pickup configuration, I replaced the pickguard. The original was a single-ply black pickguard (nonstandard number of screws). The pickguard you see in these photos is a standard 11-screw three-ply (black-white-black) HSS item. Interestingly (to me, at least) even this isn't the first alternative pickguard I installed on this guitar. Once upon a time, I had a mirror (reflective) pickguard in my best imitation of Philip Lynott's [mirror bass][mirror-bass]. Unfortunately, mine was plastic (unlike Phil's chrome pickguard) and it did not do well with my nasty, nasty sweat.

Now, the photos. First, the glamour shot:

Then the headstock:

And, finally, a strap button:

By the way: that fingerboard wear is real. This guitar has been played hard over the years. No [relicing][relicing] for me!

Anyway, I am going to customize the hell out of this guitar.
