Anybody who knows me will attest that my music tastes are stuck firmly in the past: specifically the [late 1970s][bad-reputation] or in the early 1990s. For some reason, listening to new music has always been kind of difficult for me. However, I am now proud to share with you some recent (for me!) stuff that I'm really getting into: [King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard][king-gizzard]. Now, I know that they're not exactly a new band, but they have not been around much more than ten years, which is pretty new by my standards. More importantly, however, is that they are an ongoing concern. In fact, King Gizz fans are excitedly awaiting some kind of new album release right now (mid-August 2020) and have two singles, [Honey][honey] and [Some of Us][some-of-us], out to build up a buzz.

Anyway, I am the proud owner of five KGATLW albums so far and I am going to present my obligatory ranking and initial thoughts about them:

| Rank | Title | Release date | Initial thoughts |
| 1 | ![Flying Microtonal Banana]({{ site.url }}/assets/2020-08-18-kgatlw/flying-microtonal-banana.jpg) Flying Microtonal Banana | February 2017 | My first KGATW album: love the quarter tones, learnt to love the distorted vocals |
| 2 | ![Infest the Rats' Nest]({{ site.url }}/assets/2020-08-18-kgatlw/infest-the-rats-nest.png) | August 2019 | KGATLW's heaviest (and most recent) album |
| 3 | ![Polygondwanaland]({{ site.url }}/assets/2020-08-18-kgatlw/polygondwanaland.jpg) | November 2017 | Love it! |
| 4 | ![Nonagon Infinity]({{ site.url }}/assets/2020-08-18-kgatlw/nonagon-infinity.png) | April 2016 | Some good songs; unfortunately many of the songs sound the same to me, right now at least |
| 5 | ![Paper M&â€Œacirc;ch&eacute; Dream Balloon]({{ site.url }}/assets/2020-08-18-kgatlw/paper-mache-dream-balloon.jpg) | November 2015 | I was a little disappointed with this one: I hope it will grow on me with repeated listening |
