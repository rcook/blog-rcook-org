I live in [Bothell, Washington][bothell]. I want to call my mother in [Haworth, West Yorkshire][haworth]. But what time is it there?

That's not a terribly difficult question to get an answer for with [Google][google-query]. But, what about the more interesting question:

> What was the time difference between Bothell, Washington and Haworth, West Yorkshire over time?

# Overview

To answer this question, we'll use [Haskell][haskell], of course. We're also going to use the following:

* My new favourite function [`for_`][for-doc], which I use for pretty much everything these days
* The [`time`][time-hackage] package
* The [`tz`][tz-hackage] package

I want to generate a list of every day in a given year along with the effective time zones in both Bothell and Haworth and the corresponding difference in hours and minutes between the times (at midnight) in these two locations.

# Step 1: A sequence of UTC days

We can make a single UTC day as follows:

{% gist 1ed485ee5530af7ac2f89c1e4ac559f1 Snippet0.hs %}

That's 1 January 2018, just in case you were wondering.

I scratched my head thinking about how to generate a sequence for a little while. At first I was planning to `map` the [`fromGregorian`][fromGregorian-doc] function over various sequences of numbers. However, this requires knowledge of the number of days in each month in each year and lots of similar nastiness. How else to do this? Well, fortunately for me, `time` also exposes an [`addDays`][addDays-doc] function. With this, we should be able to generate a list of calendar days by mapping some function of this function and our `startDay` over a list:

{% gist 1ed485ee5530af7ac2f89c1e4ac559f1 Snippet1.hs %}

or

{% gist 1ed485ee5530af7ac2f89c1e4ac559f1 Snippet2.hs %}

# Step 2: Time zone in effect at a given UTC time

The `tz` package exposes functions like [`timeZoneForPOSIX`][timeZoneForPOSIX-doc] and [`diffForPOSIX`][diffForPOSIX-doc] which sound like they may do what we need. Unfortunately, both functions deal in terms of `Int64` values and the documentation for the package does not explain what this `Int64` is directly. So, I had to take a look at the code. After doing that, I figured out that I need the `Int64` that is the result type of the [`utcTimeToInt64`][utcTimeToInt64-doc] function in the `Data.Time.Zones.Internal` module.

This leads to the following function:

{% gist 1ed485ee5530af7ac2f89c1e4ac559f1 tzOffsetInfo.hs %}

`Minutes` is a `newtype` wrapper around `Int`.

This function takes a [`TZ`][TZ-doc] (which is a time zone database entry for a given geographical location), a [`UTCTime`][UTCTime-doc] (which we can derive from our Gregorian [`Day`][Day-doc] from above) and returns the time difference from UTC in minutes as well as the name of the time zone in effect (encoded using the [`TimeZone`][TimeZone-doc]) type.

Since the hidden `utcTimeToInt64` function is critical to interoperability between `tz` and `time` (I think), I'll probably file an issue against the package and submit a pull request to make this function part of the public API. If I get time, of course. That was a terrible pun.

# The full program

Now, all we need to do is apply our `tzOffsetInfo` function to a stream of `UTCTime` instances deriving from our stream of `Day` instances and print the results out. I present the full program here:

{% gist 1ed485ee5530af7ac2f89c1e4ac559f1 Main.hs %}

There, that was a quick introduction to time and time zones in Haskell.
