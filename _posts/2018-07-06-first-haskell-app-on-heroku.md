I finally got round to it! I've written a very simple [Snap][snap-framework] web app in Haskell and successfully deployed it to [Heroku][heroku]. [Here][rcookhaskell-app]'s the deployed app and [here][rcookhaskell-github]'s the code.

I followed these two references:

* [heroku-buildpack-stack][heroku-buildpack-stack] by Mark Fine
