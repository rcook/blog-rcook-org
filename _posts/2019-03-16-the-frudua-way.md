[This][frudua-way] is supposedly one way to keep your [Fender Stratocaster][strat]-style guitar in tune even with over-the-top use of the [whammy][whammy] bar. I'm going to test this out tonight.

Amazingly it worked. I was sceptical. I've been struggling with the tuning stability of my Squier [Silver Series][silver-series] Strat for over twenty-five years and this seemed to fix it.
