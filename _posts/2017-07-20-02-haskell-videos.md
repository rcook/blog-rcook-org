As I mentioned [previously]({% post_url 2017-07-19-update %}), I have been designing and recording a series of two-hour video courses intended to teach introductory Haskell. They are published by [Packt Publishing][packt]. I thought I'd share some links with you:

* [Fundamentals of Practical Haskell Programming][part1] (published 28 March 2017): A two-hour introductory video course teaching the basics of practical Haskell programming
* [Writing Haskell Programs][part2] (published 29 May 2017): A two-hour Haskell programming video course: builds upon "Fundamentals of Practical Haskell Programming"
* Building an Application with Haskell (to be published some time in August 2017): A two-hour Haskell programming video course: builds upon "Writing Haskell Programs"

I have studiously avoided mention of [category theory][bartosz].
