I'm just checking in since I haven't written anything in a while. I've been concentrating on things other than writing code in my spare time for a little while and have thus neglected my blog.

I have just slapped Windows 10 back onto my ThinkPad T520 and loaded it up with the following:

* [Reaper][reaper]
* [EZdrummer 2][ezdrummer]

I also bought a copy of [Band in a Box][biab].

I've already recorded an album's worth of new material but I haven't produced any lyrics or vocals yet.

[reaper]: http://reaper.fm/
