Since I'm maintaining
[`user_impersonate2`](https://github.com/rcook/user_impersonate2) which is, more
or less, now the official successor to
[`user_impersonate`](https://github.com/engineyard/user_impersonate), I've
decided to start writing a proper tutorial for it:

* [https://github.com/rcook/user_impersonate2-tutorial-notes](https://github.com/rcook/user_impersonate2-tutorial-notes)
* [https://github.com/rcook/user_impersonate2-tutorial-sample-app](https://github.com/rcook/user_impersonate2-tutorial-sample-app)
