Another quick one! I thought I'd sit down and figure out how to run some Haskell code in [AWS Lambda][aws-lambda]. I took a look at the [serverless-haskell][serverless-haskell] package and thought I'd show you the fruits of my investigation. My project makes uses of the `AWSHaskell` module from serverless-haskell but dispenses with all the npm stuff. Right now, you just run the `pkg` script which will generate a zip archive in the right format for AWS Lambda which you can then upload. Note that you'll need to build on Linux to generate compatible binaries for use on Lambda. Done.

## Part 1: `Main.hs`

* Demonstrates the basic of how to take in and return JSON objects

## Part 2: `hlambda.cabal`

* Bare minimal dependencies

{% gist 18ad77c1a101e8b758a068aba1885951 hlambda.cabal %}

## Part 3: `index.js`

* Standard JavaScript bootstrap

{% gist 18ad77c1a101e8b758a068aba1885951 index.js %}

## Part 4: `pkg`

* Packaging script
* The resulting `.zip` file can be uploaded using [awscli][awscli]

{% gist 18ad77c1a101e8b758a068aba1885951 pkg %}

## Part 5: `stack.yaml`

* Minimal

{% gist 18ad77c1a101e8b758a068aba1885951 stack.yaml %}

## Done
