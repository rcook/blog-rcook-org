Another quick one! I thought I'd sit down and figure out how to run some Haskell code in [AWS Lambda][aws-lambda]. I took a look at the [serverless-haskell][serverless-haskell] package and thought I'd show you the fruits of my investigation. Check out [hlambda][https://github.com/rcook/hlambda]. This uses the `AWSHaskell` module from serverless-haskell but dispenses with all the npm stuff. Right now, you just run the `pkg` script which will generate a zip archive in the right format for AWS Lambda which you can then upload. Note that you'll need to build on Linux to generate compatible binaries for use on Lambda. Done.
