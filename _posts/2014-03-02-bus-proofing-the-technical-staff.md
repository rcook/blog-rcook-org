* Pick a random member of the technical staff
* Imagine that person is incapacitated, e.g. hit by a bus
* What is your plan to deal with it?
* Can somebody else easily figure out the following?
  * How to view the source code
  * How to fix bugs in it
  * How to build it
  * How to deploy it
  * etc.
* Then there are metaproblems:
  * Who knows the passwords?
  * Who knows where the servers are and how to access them?
