I've been playing with the [Z3][z3] prover over the last couple of weeks. I want to consume the output from the Haskell programs, so I hacked together an s-expression parser, namely [sexpr-parser][sexpr-parser-0.1.1.2]. It's pretty bare-bones, but it gets the job done.

**Update: 2019-02-09**

I was asked [why anybody would want to use this package][issue]. This is a good question. This, as with almost all my other packages on Hackage, is a personal package and nobody is compelled to use it. Furthermore, there are many other good s-expression parsers out there, e.g. [S-Cargot][s-cargot], so please feel free to use these instead. However, the main characteristics of this package are as follows:

* It's simple
* It uses [Megaparsec][megaparsec] which means that parse errors are fairly good
* Its efficiency is just fine for my purposes (for now!)

That's it! I'll update the [README][readme] the next time I find myself working on this project. Thanks!
