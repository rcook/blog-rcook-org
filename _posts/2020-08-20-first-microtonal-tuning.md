I do not yet own a fretless guitar or a [guitar fretted with quarter tones][marrakesh]. I do have some [fretlets][fretlet] but do not (yet) have a classical guitar to put them on. However, I do own a [quarter-tone tuner][rohab]. In this short post, I'm going to put it to use by experimenting with the most simple quarter-tone tuning I can think of: tune to standard tuning and drop every other string by a quarter tone. Here are the pitches of the six strings:

* Ed (thinnest)
* B
* Gd
* D
* Ad
* E (thickest)

Where _d_ means "half-flat".

Here's one rendering of the [Bayati maqam][bayati] in this tuning:

```
Ed|--------------------
B |--------------------
Gd|--------------------
D |--------------------
Ad|-----7--------------
E |--10----13-15-17-18-
```

This is not great for speed or ease of playing. Here's another:

```
Ed|--------------------
B |--------------------
Gd|--------------------
D |--------3-5-7-8-----
Ad|-----7--------------
E |--10----------------
```

This might be an improvement depending on the specifics of your situation. I will post more when I've experimented with other fingerings and tunings.
