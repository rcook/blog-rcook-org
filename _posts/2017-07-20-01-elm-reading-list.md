As I mentioned [previously]({% post_url 2017-07-19-update %}, I am learning [Elm][elm-lang]. I love this clean, straightforward functional programming. Its obvious similarities to [Haskell][haskell] don't hurt either. In fact, I think Elm-in-the-browser/Haskell-on-the-server might be my current favourite development stack.

Anyway, my current learning resources are as follows:

* [Elm in Action][elm-in-action] by Richard Feldman
* [The JSON Survival Kit][json-survival-kit] by Brian Hicks
* [Elm Town][elm-town], Murphy Randle's podcast
