I haven't posted for a while, so I thought I'd write something to let anybody who cares know that I'm still around.

I'm writing this post from beautiful [Shoshoni][shoshoni] in sunny [Rollinsville, Colorado][rollinsville] in the Rockies.

I'm finishing off writing and recording my Haskell video course [Fundamentals of Practical Haskell][haskell-course] while busily learning the basics of the [Elm][elm-lang] programming language. I went to [LambdaConf 2017][lambdaconf] back in May which was also, coincidentally, in sunny Colorado: in Boulder, to be precise. In September, I'll be off to [Elm-Conf][elm-conf] in St. Louis.

So, with all of this, as well as moving house to sunny [Bothell, Washington][bothell] (just up the road from my former residence in Kirkland), things have been busy, busy, busy!

I hope to blog more soon.
