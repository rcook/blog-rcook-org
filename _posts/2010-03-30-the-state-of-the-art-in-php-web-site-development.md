Quite a grandiose title, to be sure, and I'm sure it won't quite live up to all
the hype, but I'm pretty pleased with it anyway:
[katyandrichard.com](http://katyandrichard.com/). Here's a list of its salient
features:

* [It's built with PHP 5._x_](http://www.php.net/)
* [It uses MySQL 5._x_ at the back end](http://www.mysql.com/)
* [It uses Smarty 2.6._x_ as the server-side templating
framework](http://www.smarty.net/)
* [It uses a derivative of John Resig's JavaScript micro-templating for
in-browser templating](http://ejohn.org/)
* [It employs OpenID for authentication to the admin
module](http://www.openid.net/)
* [It uses the Prototype 1.6 JavaScript framework](http://www.prototypejs.org/)
* It's fairly pleasing to the eye
* It's fully localizable and uses UTF-8 throughout
* As a proof of concept it's (poorly) translated into
[French](http://katyandrichard.com/fr/) and
[German](http://katyandrichard.com/de/) as well as
[English](http://katyandrichard.com/en/)
