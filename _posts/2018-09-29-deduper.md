My current mission, other than selling all my old tech crap on eBay, is to finally get my data backup strategy in order.

I've moved all my files to my [Synology DS212][ds212] NAS and along the way I've found many redundant copies of my music collection. Synology has the pretty nice [Storage Analyzer][storage-analyzer] package for analysing disc usage etc. Unfortunately, it is not well adapted for bulk file deduplication as files must be deleted one by one.

So, I present [Deduper][deduper]. This is a minimal-dependency Python script that can run directly on the NAS (via SSH) without requiring the device to be modded in any way.

The script will perform SHA1-hash-based duplicate detection and then (optionally) delete duplicates based on a "keep-first-in-copy-aware-order" strategy which seems to work pretty well for music files.
