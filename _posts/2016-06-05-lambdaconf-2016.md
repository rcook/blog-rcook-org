I attended [LambdaConf 2016][lambdaconf] in Boulder, Colorado, from 26 to 28
May 2016. This was my first time in Boulder and the views of the mountains were
quite impressive. Maybe if I go next year I'll take the time to climb up some
of those mountains:

So, on to the conference: I had a great time and had the opportunity to meet
many interesting people. Now, it's important to remember that this was a
functional programming conference, so the geekiness was turned all the way up
to 11. It was all semigroups, monads and setoids. And it was bliss. 

Highlights for me included: 

* [Sharon Steed][sharon-steed]'s keynote: Sharon steed impressed me. She is a
motivational speaker who has fought and overcome a serious stutter. I think we
could all learn a great deal from her experience. 
* Meeting Sepideh of [Maptime Boulder][maptime-boulder]: Maptime Boulder is a
group of hardcore map enthusiasts and they are big fans of Tableau's mapping
capabilities. Had I known about this beforehand, I would've made a special
detour to talk to the group's members at one of their regular meetings. I am by
no means a Tableau map expert, but it's great to know that there are people out
there who are so passionate about it!
* Seeing the best monad tutorial so far (courtesy of
[Marcus Griep][marcus-griep]: I think achieve transcendence or, at least,
experienced the best five-minute monad tutorial so far in my life. And I've
seen a lot of them. If anybody wants me to present his material to them, please
let me know! [Here][monads-are-not-burritos]'s a direct link to the
presentation.
* Meeting Chris Allen and Julie Moronuki: I'm a big fan of their book
["Haskell Programming from First Principles"][haskell-book]. Good people! Great
novelty Haskell T-shirts! 

This is a necessarily brief rundown of the highlights.
