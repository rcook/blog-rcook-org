In a mission to make my app's file download more responsive, I had fun integrating John Culviner's [`jquery.fileDownload.js`](https://github.com/johnculviner/jquery.fileDownload) script. John's samples and setup instructions all target ASP .NET MVC while my app is a Rails 4 app. I thought it'd be a fun exercise to package this script up into a gem much like [`jquery-ui-rails`](https://github.com/joliss/jquery-ui-rails) packages up jQuery UI for Rails. I've named it [`jquery_file_download-rails`](https://github.com/rcook/jquery_file_download-rails) and here are the relevant links:

* https://github.com/rcook/jquery_file_download-rails
* https://rubygems.org/gems/jquery_file_download-rails

The GitHub project also contains basic instructions for setting up the gem and the script within a Rails app.

I hope it's useful to someone.
