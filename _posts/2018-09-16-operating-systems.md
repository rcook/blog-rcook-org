The other I decided I want to learn more about how operating systems work. I've already talked about [Linux from Scratch]{% post_url 2018-09-03-linux-from-scratch %}) the other day. My efforts to finish this have temporarily stalled, but it has been very instructive nonetheless. On a related subject, I've started following Viktor Engelmann's [Write Your Own Operating System][wyoos-playlist] video series on YouTube. This is good stuff. Once I've done that, then I'm planning to tackle [User-Mode Linux][user-mode-linux].
