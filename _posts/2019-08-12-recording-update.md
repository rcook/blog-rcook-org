Recording is going well. Lyric writing and recording vocals is still a struggle. However, here is a provisional track listing for my upcoming EP:

1. Light the Way
2. Where's the Sun
3. Don't Feel the Rain
4. A World for Me
5. Lou
6. Solitude
7. Catch You Unawares
8. Psychosomatic

Of course, these are all brand-new songs, so this probably doesn't mean much to anybody except me. I started writing and recording in July and I hope to have all the songs recorded (including vocals) in demo form by the middle of September.
