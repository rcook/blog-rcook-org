Recording is going well. Lyric writing and recording vocals is still a struggle. However, here's a provisional track listing for my upcoming EP:

1. Light the Way
2. Where's the Sun
3. Don't Feel the Rain
4. A World for Me
5. Lou
6. Solitude
7. Catch You Unawares
8. Psychosomatic

Of course, these are all brand-new songs, so this probably doesn't mean much to anybody except me. I started writing and recording in July and I hope to have all the songs recorded (including vocals) in demo form by the middle of September. My ultimate plan is to publish the EP, provisionally entitled _Psychosomatic_, for free via [SoundCloud profile][soundcloud].

This will be my first complete solo project (other than individual songs) and will even include some of my singing (horror!). Of course, the full-length album I made with From the Fall is still available for [download from Amazon][entropy-amazon]: though this thing is nearly _fifteen_ years old now!
