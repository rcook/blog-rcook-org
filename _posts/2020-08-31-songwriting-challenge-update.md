I completed the [30-day speed songwriting challenge][thirty-day] ahead of schedule. So, I have fifteen freshly minted songs:

* One of a Kind
* Loss of Control
* Enough
* Adoration
* I Will Always Win
* Big Man
* Somebody Too
* Sing for Myself
* The Warning
* Fake
* Celebrate
* Rise
* Let It Go
* Goodbye to All That
* Hurting

Right now you only get to see the titles. I need to rewrite and re-record all of them before I'm comfortable sharing them with the world!
