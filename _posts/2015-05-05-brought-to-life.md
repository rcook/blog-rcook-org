So, here are my initial impressions on powering up [06-ALA01-0003584][1]:

* No sound out of the speaker
* Composite video decidedly disappointing:
  * Flickering
  * No colour (eBay listing claims that [composite video colour hack][2] has
been applied)
  * Vertical resolution mismatched with that of my TV
* Katy totally underwhelmed

I suspect (i.e. hope) that much of the video problems will be resolved using a
composite-video-to-VGA converter I have on order. Obviously, the Acorn Electron
is a UK machine and there might be some mismatch between the composite video
output of the computer and the expectations of my made-for-the-US-market TV set
(50 Hz vs. 60 Hz, PAL vs. NTSC etc. As for the lack of sound, I'm hoping that
the seller forgot to reconnect the speaker cable or it came out in transit. We
shall see!

It's getting late and I don't have time to get my tools out and open up the case
yet.

* In between the flickering the video output is OK:
