I've decided to start [blogging like a
hacker](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html).
In a way, using something like [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is
exactly how I've wanted to manage my blog ever since I
[started]({% post_url 2010-03-16-blog %}) without realizing it. It's now under a
proper version control system, free from the tyranny of a database and should
prove much more straightforward to maintain.

I've migrated all the old content from my old [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/)
installation. To be honest, it wasn't that difficult:
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) provides some scripts and there wasn't that much
content anyway.
