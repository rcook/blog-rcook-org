I'm not sure what this is building up to, but another thing on my to-do list is to learn how to use the [Z3][z3] theorem prover. This [repo][z3-smt-from-scratch] is where I'm saving my experiments.

Example (1):

{% gist 752152e0feb3ad7626e6d37275e421a4 ex1.smt2 %}

Example (2):

{% gist 752152e0feb3ad7626e6d37275e421a4 ex2.smt2 %}

**Update (2019-01-17)**

Added some examples.
