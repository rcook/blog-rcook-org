It's time to learn [Scala][scala]. I took Martin Odersky's [course][progfun1] a couple of years ago and thoroughly enjoyed it. Now that some time has passed and I've been deeply immersed in all things [Haskell][haskell], I feel it's a good time to revisit Scala.

I thought I'd take a look at [algebraic data types][adt] which is, I believe, something that Haskell excels at.

That's a lot of typing. "The world's most verbose sum types", as someone once said.

But, at least I can pattern-match on it!

Surprisingly, the Haskell version _isn't_ significantly shorter in terms of line count:

Though there is less line noise.

Here's another side-by-side comparison of an extension to my simple expression language embedded in an algebraic data type. This adds `Option` (`Maybe`) types to the evaluation function, making this a convenient vehicle for demonstrating how to handle applicative and monadic computations using [Scalaz][scalaz]:

Haskell:

{% gist dd4db779353cde36646c3a78736ebb2d Expr.hs %}

The two pieces of code look remarkably similar. Haskell has a much more compact (and, in my opinion, intuitive) way of defining the `Expr` sum type. Haskell's `Applicative` (baked into `Prelude`) provides the elegance of `<$>` and `<*>` but, other than that, they're clearly similar. The `flatMap`/`for`-comprehension vs. `do`-notation is eerily similar, in fact.

All in all, all this `flatMap`ping etc. makes a lot more sense now that I have Haskell in my veins. Furthermore, Scala's syntactic noise is tolerable. Given that I primarily write Java at work and Haskell at home, Scala feels like a nice midway point between the two. I am confident that Scala will feel like a nice warm fuzzy comfort blanket one day!

Here's a translation into Java:
