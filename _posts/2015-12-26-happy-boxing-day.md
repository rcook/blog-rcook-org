It's been a while since I last posted, but I thought I would just to keep the
old blog ticking over.

So, what's been happening? I spent most of my day yesterday putting together
Lego kits for my older son, Lewis. Fortunately, I love playing with Lego, so
that was a pleasant way to spend a large part of the day.

Other than that, I continue to tinker away at Haskell projects. I've also
started a rewrite of my old [Ripl][1] project in modern C++. I've also decided
to really start to learn [Vim][2], largely because I don't trust any of the
other development tools for Haskell hacking.

That is all.
