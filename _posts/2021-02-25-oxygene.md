I'm back. As you may know, February was [The Future Bites][sw] month. This album grew on me over the course of the month. Wilson's production is, of course, excellent. My opinion regarding the album's standout songs has not changed much: [Man of the People][man-of-the-people] is by far my favourite song in this album. [King Ghost][king-ghost] is up there. The others are OK too. However, by the end of February, I started to get bored. Perhaps this is natural after listening to the album repeatedly over the course of the month.

Anyway, I am ready to jump into March's Album of the Month. I covered brand-new stuff in January and February. In March, I'm going to take a trip back to 1977 with [Oxyg&egrave;ne][oxygene] by [Jean-Michel Jarre][jean-michel-jarre]. I used to listen to these tunes a lot as a child before I got into guitars and stuff. Anyway, I came across [Oxyg&agrave;ne&mdash;Live in Your Living Room][live-in-your-living-room] on YouTube and was inspired to buy the original album.
