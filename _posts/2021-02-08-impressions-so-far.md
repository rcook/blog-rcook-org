Here are a few quick notes about my initial impressions [Versions of the Truth][versions-of-the-truth] and [The Future Bites][sw]:

## _Versions of the Truth_

Standout songs:

* Break It All
* Leave Me Be

I love Gavin Harrison's fussy hi-hat, so I'm sold. I have my playlist for this album directly after The Future Bites and it's pretty good when this album starts up. I need to ponder Bruce Soord's vocals a bit more before I write any more about that.

## _The Future Bites_

Standout songs:

* Unself
* King Ghost
* Man of the People

This is supposed to be Steven Wilson's "pop" record. I don't know that that is my impression of this album at all: replace the drum machine with acoustic drums and you'd have yourself a pretty standard Steven Wilson album. The songs are growing on me and it's likely my opinion of the album's standout songs will evolve over time.
