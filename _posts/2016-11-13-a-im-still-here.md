I haven't posted in a while. I have a few minutes going spare this morning, so
I thought I'd let you know that all is well and that I've been very busy:

* [Tableau Conference 2016][tc16]: I'm exhausted after spending four days in
Austin. It was great fun, however, and I got to speak (albeit only for 90
seconds) in front of a crowd of 1,200 people.
* [Category theory for programmers][ctp]: Bartosz's latest class just wound up
and went pretty well. Attendees are already clamouring for a part deux!
* Beginning Practical Haskell: I've started putting together a course of my
own: I intend to do a dry run of this class in front of my fellow
[Tabloids][tableau] before releasing it on the public. The project I'm going to
take students through will relate to web scraping.
* [Machine Learning in Action][mlinaction]: I've started working through this
book on machine learning. [Bartosz][bartosz] assures me that ML is the future.
This book is written in Python and I thought it might be an interesting project
to translate this into Haskell.
