Here's my first real use of [ports][ports] in an [Elm][elm] application. It'll be light on the commentary, heavy on code.

### `.gitignore`

Ignore some generated files and assets:

{% gist 47e67e065a85b4542601565c1f6bbbe2 .gitignore %}

[elm]: https://elm-lang.org/
[ports]: https://guide.elm-lang.org/interop/javascript.html
