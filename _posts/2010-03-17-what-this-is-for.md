I'm going to write about software engineering, computer science and web
development. The following are the technologies of particular interest to me at
the moment:

* Ruby on Rails&mdash;this is what I use at work
* C#/.NET&mdash;this is what I used to use at work
* Python&mdash;love it
* PHP&mdash;I use this for most of my personal projects
