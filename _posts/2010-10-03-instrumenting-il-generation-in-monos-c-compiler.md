<p>Someone asked me the other day how I'd go about instrumenting the IL generated by the Mono C# compiler: something to do with custom profiling I think. I still haven't come up with a totally satisfactory answer but here's a patch of some work I did showing how I hacked away at various bits of the sources to emit custom method prologues and epilogues. Download the patch and apply it to your Mono Git repo.</p>
<p>Here is a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3848001/extending-the-mono-c-compiler-is-there-any-documentation-or-precedent">Stack Overflow question</a> I asked about the preferred method of extending the C# compiler. This relates to my plan to do very spiffy things to <tt>mcs</tt>'s ASTs and type checker!</p>
