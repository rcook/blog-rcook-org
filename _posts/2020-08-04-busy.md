I don't normally like to drop quotes since I generally dislike others quoting famous or supposedly clever people at me since it feels lazy and unoriginal. However, this one is too good and too true to pass over:

This is a quick post just to let you know that I am still around! I haven't written much non-work-related code of late, though I continue to be fascinated with Rust. I have been concentrating mostly on music. About a year ago I was deep in the middle of writing and recording my mini-album, [Psychosomatic]({% post_url 2019-11-17-psychosomatic-on-cdbaby %}). My plan at the time was to release a steady trickle of new music after that and this is something that I have singularly failed to do. So, I'm recommitting to music and August 2020 is my thirty-one-day songwriting challenge. My aim is to have fifteen shiny new songs written along with rough demo recordings by 31 August. Once that's out of the way, I plan to spend September rearranging and recording them properly so that I can demonstrate some artistic and creative development during 2020. A global pandemic will not stand in my way.
