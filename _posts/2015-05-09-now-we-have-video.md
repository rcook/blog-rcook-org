On the 06-ALA01-0003584 front, we have mostly good news! One S-video-to-VGA
converter later, and we have our composite video output hooked up to a modern
computer monitor. The picture is clear and crisp. It's probably the best video
output I've ever seen an Electron produce.

* Here's the converter:

* Here's a nice crisp output image:

Unfortunately, we still don't have colour and the last few scan lines of the
picture are missing. My current theory is that the former is a PAL vs. NTSC
problem that might not be easily or cheaply solved. On the balance of things,
however, this doesn't bother me too much: real Acorn Electron users don't
leave Mode 6 or use `VDU 19` anyway! The missing scan lines, however...
