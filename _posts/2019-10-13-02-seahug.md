I've organized the [Seattle Area Haskell Users' Group][seahug] for a few years
now, but I have decided that it is time to step down. Our next meeting, on
Saturday 19 October, will be the last hosted by me. I'm hoping that we can find
another organizer and venue to get the meetings going again, if there is call
for it.
